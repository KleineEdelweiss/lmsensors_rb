  # they have been shortened from 'SENSORS_FEATURE_'
  # to 'SF_'.

  # This hash maps commonly-used limit types from
  # the SENSORS_SUBFEATURE_* constants.
  # 
  # I have not included ALL the subfeatures types,
  # because there are around 100 of them, and most of
  # them provide no post-processing value. I have, however,
  # included the following subfeature groups for
  # the _POWER_, _IN_, _CURR_, and _FAN_ categories:
  # 
  # MIN, MAX, a couple HYST (hysteresis) types, INPUT,
  # and a couple AVERAGE types.
  # 
  # NOTE: For the MOST part, the below list is provided
  # for convenience, only. You can use it to create your
  # own mappers, if you are not sure what subtypes are
  # included in the normal feature objects.
  # 
  # I had actually considered removing everything below,
  # but I realized that simply swapping the keys with the
  # values actually provides a simpler way for others to
  # access the types and provide some default key types
  # they might want to use in their subclasses, even if it's 
  # somewhat redundant.
