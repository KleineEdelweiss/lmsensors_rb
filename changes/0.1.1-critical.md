# SUMMARY #

**Date**
2021-Jul-22

**Version**
0.1.1

**Severity**
[CRITICAL UPDATE]

**Description**
PLEASE REVIEW THE SAME ISSUE FROM: https://github.com/KleineEdelweiss/alsactl_rb/blob/master/changes/0.1.1-critical.md. The critical update is of the same nature.

Again, thanks to a suggestion by https://github.com/sampersand @sampersand, on reviewing the ``openssl`` gem, I found out the correct way to link the extension was to leave the compiled object inside the extension directory, and to ``require 'lmsensors_base.so'``, instead of using ``require_relative`` and the local path.

**Final Notes**
Please make sure to update this gem, if you have it installed, as the next Ruby version you upgrade to will NOT allow this to work, otherwise.
